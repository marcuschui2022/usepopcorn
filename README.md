# Practice Project: Thinking in React - Components, Composition, and Reusability

This practice project is designed around "Thinking in React: Components, Composition, and Reusability". It was initially
setup with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the Project

In the project's root directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

This starts the application in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The application will automatically reload when you make source file changes.

### `npm test`

This command executes the test runner in watch mode.
Refer to the guide on [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `npm run build`

This command compiles the application for deployment, optimizing it for the best performance. The output is located in
the `build` folder.
For more on deployment, refer to the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

Only run this command if you're comfortable with removing `create-react-app`'s build dependency. It gives you full
control over the build scripts and configuration.
